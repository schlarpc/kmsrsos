      #
      #   * the generated product data `kmsrs-db`'s build.rs compiles into

      #   * the committed golden wire vectors (TEST-002, #223) and fuzz seeds

      #     reads them;
      #   * the packaging files, because `packaging_invariants.rs` asserts
      #     properties *of* them — that the image is two static binaries, that
      #     `replicas: 1` is hardcoded, that every dependency is pinned. A test
